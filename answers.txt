1. It depends upon how densely populated the graph is, and how close the goal node is to the start node, as the more densely populated a graph is, the more intensive a breadth-first search becomes, however, if the goal is closer to the start then breadth first search should find it faster

2. O(V+E), with V standing for vertex and E standing for edge, because every single one would need to be explored if it finds it as the last element.

3. A network of friends is usually sparsely connected as there is an upper limit to the amount of relationships someone can have while only being limited by the entire userbase for the size of the network. By storing only the actual connections an adjacency list is more memory eifficient than an adjacency matrix which stores the status of all edges, whether true or not.

4. If a quiz allowed unlimited retries and did not randomize the order of the questions, the quiz could be completed by simply always answering yes, noting when an answer is incorrect and marking that question down as no for future attempts, and then repeating until the quiz is completed.
